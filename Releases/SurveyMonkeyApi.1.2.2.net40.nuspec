        <description>Makes it easy to work with the Survey Monkey API from within .NET, handles paging and rate-limiting for you, and processes raw data to show how responses map to questions.</description>
        <summary>A library for accessing v2 of the Survey Monkey API.</summary>
        <releaseNotes>-Fix crash when ordering GetSurveyList, GetCollectorList, and GetRespondentList by ascending order (this never worked).
-OrderBy and OrderAsc parameters are now not added to api calls by default, but will always be added when explicitly set. OrderBy was previously always added with the same default value as the api's own default (respondent_id). OrderAsc was previously added only when set to true but never when set to false (relying instead on falling over to the api's default).</releaseNotes>
